Future work may increase the dataset to encompass additional samples and platforms, such as Google Reviews or Booking.com. Another area of potential improvement is the use of Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) with fine-tuned transformer models to automatically detect and examine specific features mentioned in reviews, for example, service, cleanliness, or amenities. Constructing an interactive dashboard using Streamlit or Dash would also enable real-time sentiment monitoring for hotel managers. Finally, incorporating multilingual reviews would make the system more applicable and inclusive for users around the world.
